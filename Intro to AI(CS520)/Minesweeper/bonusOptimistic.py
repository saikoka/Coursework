# Changes from Base_Agent:
# Created variable "d = len(environment)" and redefined "size"
# Condensed if/else statements using for loops
# Changed main while condition to "while len(mine_or_safe) != size:"
# Added more comments
# Removed "discovered" and replaced one instance of it with "mine_or_safe"
# Added if statement to the cell investigation for loops to account for case where cell has been flagged
# Added score calculator, with score defined the way Dr. Cowan re-defined it in the most recent lecture
# Defined "print_dictionary" function at top
# Imported math
# Added driver script at bottom; includes example environment
